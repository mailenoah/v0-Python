# Write a function `most_letter_word(sentence, char)` that accepts:
# - a sentence string
# - a single character
#
# The function should return the word in the sentence that contains the
# character the greatest number of times.
#
# You can assume the sentence contains at least one word.
# If there is a tie, return the word that appears first in the sentence.
